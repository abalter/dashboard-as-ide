Hi @vitmalina. I understand your point, and there may be many who agree with you from a strictly UI theory point of view. However, if you look at science-oriented IDEs, they all work like this. Scientific programmers are no longer writing programs. We do everything with data and visualization. Consequently, IDEs have turned into dashboards with this kind of drag-and-drop capability. A science-oriented IDE will have source panes, a command line, a terminal, a file explorer, a help panel, a plot panel, a history panel, etc., etc. And the user wants to arrange these to their liking.

Consider the images below of some common IDEs.

I want to build a pure javascript IDE like that. I understand that may be different from your use case. But it is why I want a UI with this sort of flexibility.
