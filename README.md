# dashboard-as-ide

A datascience IDE has a number of common parts:
- Code editor
- Notebook editor and viewer
- Plot window
- Table/variable viewer
- Help documentation
- File explorer/manager/tree
- Notebook preview
- Command terminal

Maybe others as well

Many of these naturally fit into dashboards. 

Rather than add features to an IDE to make it more like a dashboard, build a dashboard that has 
all the features of a code editor IDE and the rest.
